Restuarant Picker - Endpoint
In this program we must generate a random restuarant. Allow the user to choose if they want a completely random restuarant, or one from a specific category.

Peer review: John Magpantay                        Notes: Clean Code, what stood out to me the most is the data validation and letting the user choose between categories of what they want randomize. Great job Overall!

INSTRUCTIONS
Before anything, open the code in VSCode and run/debug the code. This should lead to a new tab opening, labelled localhost. Copy and paste the URL from that new tab, into the Postman "GET" area. Then, add to the end of the URL like this:
https://localhost:xxxx/Restaurant/Info
The xxxx should be the 4-digit number individual to your computer. Then you wil have /Restuarant/Info. Then, hit "Send". Text should appear explaining the program, and how to continue. You will replace the word "Info" with "Random", "Coffee", "Burgers", or "Pizza". These are case sensitive :) When Random is entered, you will get a restuarant from any of the three categories. All of the others will provide restuarants specific to their label.
